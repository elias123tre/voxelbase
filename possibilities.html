      <h1 id="problem">The problem</h1>
      <p>
        Over a third of all silent movies ever made no longer exist. Perhaps you've heard of the
        Universal Studios fire of 2008, when tens of thousands of master recordings of our greatest
        artists were lost. So the media industry tells us that the films, music, the content that
        they produce is the value of their companies. And they go to extreme lengths to try to
        maintain it. And yet the acknowledge, even with their best efforts, everything is slowly
        degrading over time. And we hear that from other industries too. Like the banking sector.
        They understand exactly how risky current storage can be, how everything has to be backed up
        on a systematic basis and the potential loss of critical data, thats enough to keep them up
        at night. On a more personal note, think of all the precious data that you carry around on
        your phone. All of that is just misshap away from being lost. The demand for long-term data
        storage is reaching unprecedented levels. By 2023, it's expected that over 100 zettabytes of
        data will be stored in the cloud. Operating at such scales requires a fundamental
        re-thinking of how we build large-scale storage systems, as well as the underlying storage
        technologies that underpin them. VoxelBase™ is going to change all that forever with a
        platter of silica, a bit of glass, that looks invisible to the human eye that we can store
        data inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took the hard disk industry over 40 years to reach their platter capacity. And it took
        the optical disk industry over 25 years to reach the capacity that they're at today. We've
        been pusing on this technology for only three years and already, in this piece of glass we
        can store more data than you store in an optical disk. And we're only just at the beginning.
        A peice of glass like this can theoretically store hundreds of terrabytes of data. At
        VoxelBase™ we've been working hard on optimizing the cloud-scale storage industry using
        existing technology like hard disk drives and tape. But we've got to the stage where we just
        can't push it as far as we want, and that led us to go out and look for a new media.
      </p>

      <h1 id="solution">The solution</h1>
      <p>
        Our search led us to glass and we discovered ways to write data using pulsed femtosecond
        lasers. These are lasers that are firing extremely short pulses of light into the piece of
        glass, and where that laser heated the glass, a small dot was created and that dot can store
        data. We call that dot a voxel.
      </p>

      <h1 id="voxel">The voxel</h1>
      <p>
        Think of the voxel as like an iceberg, it's got depth and it's got orientation and we're
        able to control both the orientation and the depth of the iceberg. And thats how we can
        store multiple bits in a single voxel. We just tought this was amazing, and we thougt, how
        can we tame this technology to provide a storage system that doesn't require us to keep
        copying data from one generation to the next?
      </p>

      <h1 id="longevity">The longevity</h1>
      <p>
        It turns out glass is remarkably resilient. You can boil a silica platter in water. You can
        scrub it in steel wool. You can subject it to electric magnetic pulses. You can even broil
        it at 260 degrees Celsius. The data, once it's written inside the platter, is going to
        survive all those things. It is truly one of the most resilient media that has ever been
        found. Once you store your data in this, the data is going to be there for 100, 1 000, even
        10 000 years. And if you no longer want to keep your data, it's really simple: you can just
        melt it down and it becomes more glass.
